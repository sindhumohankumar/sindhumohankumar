## Hi Sindhu here ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack developer with over 8 years of experience in coding. Originally from India, I now call Germany home.

I thrive on building creative and functional web applications. My expertise spans across various technologies, including:

Front-End Development: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and experience with popular CMS platforms like WordPress and Joomla.
Back-End Development: PHP, MySQL, SQL, and secure payment gateway integration (Razorpay, PayPal, Authorize.Net).
Data & Integration: JSON, APIs, and version control with GIT.
New Explorations: Recently, Iâ€™ve delved into the world of React.js, eager to expand my skillset.
Iâ€™m a strong believer in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest advancements in the web development landscape. Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to bring my skills to the table.
